## What is this?
This is my slackbot app which tells me bopomofo, pinyin, Chinese definitions and Japanese translation of the Chinese word you type on slack.

If I want to add the word info which I search with this app to Wordbook(Spreadsheet), press "追加(add)" button and this app will go to add on Wordbook instead of me.
